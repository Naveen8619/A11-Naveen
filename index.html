							<article id="intro">
								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT:</h2>
	  							<h3> What is your interest in IT?  When did your interest in IT start? </h3>
									  <p>For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated with technology. This started at a young age
when I would watch family members go to the computer with problems or scenarios, and leave
having successfully fulfilled the task at hand. I had no idea how that glass box could do so many
things. It was both fascinating and frustrating, and I had to know more. My family often remind me
that I learned how to read and write at around age three, specifically so I could interact with the
computer. I would take a piece of paper and pen to them throughout the day and ask them to write
down words for me so I could type things into the computer. Initially, I used my passion for self-gain.
Spiderman cartoons and games were at the top of my list. However, as I grew older, my research
broadened, and I was absorbed in learning more about technology. My first exposure to tech was
through an old dell laptop. I spent hours playing games and really just enjoying myself. As I grew
older and technology evolved around me, I was constantly needing to know what the newest phone
was like, how much it was, and what did differently. I found myself going out of my way to learn
about different things so I could understand more about these marvellous objects surrounding me.
This in no doubt sparked my interest to learn more about technology and how to use it more, and in
better ways to make life easier and more enjoyable. My interest in IT is to use technology to help
people and make their lives easier with technology, similar to my own experiences. Whether it be a
small business, a global organisation or even just my grandmother. Technology is something that I
am passionate about and want to follow and hopefully be a driver for throughout my life.</p>
										<h3> Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?  Outline your IT experience (if any). </h3>
										<p>As mentioned before, I always had a passion for technology. However, it was not until my aunty
began working at the CSIRO that my interest in working in IT was truly ignited. Going into high
school, I had no idea what I wanted to do in the future. My aunty and I are very close, and because
we have a smaller age gap than usual, we had more of a sibling relationship than aunty and nephew.
Even though I was only ten years old at the time, I remember her telling me about her workday as a
graduate, then as a tester, and later, of most interest to me, her job as a business analyst. I would
always be intrigued and listen intently. As the years went on, I found my interest for her job grow
and grow. I was finding myself always asking questions and wanting to find out more about how
things worked. During these times, I would also hear and ask about her colleagues in different roles,
and once again I was fascinated about what the different roles entailed. This is why I believe that it
was through my aunty that my true passion for IT began.</p>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/sp.png" alt="" /></span>
										<h3> Why did you choose to come to RMIT?  </h3>
										<p>Knowing how I personally learn, I decided that the natural path for me into a career in IT, was
studying IT further at a tertiary level. When applying for courses, I had to make some big decisions.
One of the biggest decisions I have ever made was to come to RMIT. As an inexperienced outsider,
RMIT seemed like a modern, supportive, and hands-on institution that thrives on being relevant,
practical, and keeping up with this crazy and fast-paced world that we live in. Now as an RMIT
student, I can confidently say that all my considerations were correct. RMIT could not have been a
better choice for me. When comparing RMIT to other universities, I was impressed with the calibre
of courses, including the structure of the courses, but more importantly the subjects that are offered
and the flexibility that comes after core foundations are built. It covered all the areas of IT that I
wanted to explore, from programming to user centred design, and beyond. Another big factor was
RMIT’s reputation in the workforce and its ability to adapt to meet industrial demands (an example I
noted was the decision to switch a core unit from java to python, showing that RMIT is adaptive and
responsive to the real world). Not only has RMIT been ranked very highly, but feedback from
students and industry leaders is always so positive. At a more superficial level, the convenience and
everyday comfort the campus provides are fantastic. At first glance, I noted that the location is ideal,
only a couple minutes from Melbourne Central. What truly had me awe-struck though, was RMIT’s
truly unique and modern interior design and abundance of working areas that are easily accessible
and designed so well for students. From comfortable seats to ports that cater to all brick styles, I
couldn’t ask for more from a physical campus. Overall, and considering all factors, I am beyond glad
to have chosen RMIT.</p>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/rmit.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<h3> What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
										<p>During my studies I hope to learn and explore all different areas of IT to find out the type of work
areas out there, as well as my own strengths, weaknesses, likes and dislikes in order to help
streamline the direction I would like to move in. Some of the areas of IT I would like to explore
include but are not limited to cyber security, networking, software design, and information
management. On top of these skills I would also like to learn how to handle, overcome and adapt to
different situations, and perhaps more importantly, I would like to learn how best to learn, as I know
that the technology industry is one in which we need to keep evolving and learning over time .
During my time at RMIT I would also like to further grow skills relating to teamwork as I know that
being able to work in a team is an essential skill for everyday life and a major part of work life.</p>

							<article id="work">
								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/google.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My <a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/78948487221125830-business-analyst-google-tv/?q=Business%20Analyst">Ideal Job</a> is as a business analyst at Google. This job would include working with the Google TV product team to improve the user experience
through designing technology, implementing new features, and improving the use of these
technologies and features. This position would involve the collection and analysis of data which
would then help in the design and improvement of user experience. This position is extremely
appealing to me as I love research and technology, as well as helping people by improving services.
This job would allow me to be creative as well as logical in making decisions that at the need of the
day, will improve the overall user experience.</p>
								<p>This position requires the applicant to have completed a bachelor’s degree in an applicable
discipline, have 5 years of relevant experience in work with focusses on analysis, have database
query experience such as SQL, and have tangible experience in analysing data and problem solving.
In addition to this, preferred tertiary qualifications for this role include Master of Science (MS),
Master of Business Administration (MBA), or other advanced degrees and qualifications in a
relevant field. Experience with relational database such as SQL queries and use of reporting tools
such as Data Studio is preferred. The candidate should be creative and driven by results, with the
ability to power-through all stages from planning to implementation. They should be business-
minded in nature and a team player, able to work across various functions and able to present
appropriate data and insights when needed, n time and in the right context. The candidate could
preferably also have accomplished analytical and project management skills built through
experience, as well as exceptional communication skills, and a bold presence of executive form.
They will also ideally be able to effortlessly craft persuasive descriptions and adapt the wording
of complicated understandings to audiences without a technical background.</p>
								<p>I am a highly driven and determined individual with a strong work ethic. I draw on my academic experience in learning on the go and challenging myself to always strive to do better. I am a fast learner with an inquisitive nature, always looking to learn more and seek self-improvement in order to further build-up my existing skillset. I am extremely organised and dedicate time and effort into planning. I work well both alone, and as part of a team to achieve desired results. I take great pride in the work I deliver and strive to deliver work of the very highest standard. I believe that my biggest asset is that I am agile and can quickly adapt my skillset to accommodate new tools and techniques where needed and I also tend to thrive under pressure.
I have completed secondary studies and obtained my Victorian Certificate of Education. I am currently undertaking a Bachelor of Information technology at RMIT. At present, I am building my foundational knowledge of python, SQL, relational database model, entity relationship model, and will continue to build further on my knowledge and understanding of other foundational IT concepts and areas, further working to carve out a more distinct path in the industry as I go. I have inherent teamwork and collaboration skills, which I have built-on and continue to further enhance over time. </p>
								<p>While studying at RMIT and building on my skills in programming, SQL, database, business analysis, design, and information management, etc. I will actively be looking for opportunities to gain 5 years of experience in an analytical role. I will also search for an undergraduate position which will further my skills and provide the experience needed for the job. If I am still not qualified enough, I will complete a master’s in information technology, helping my chances of getting the position.</p>

								<h3>16Personalities Test</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/test1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I believe that the test results suggest that I am an outgoing person that uses logic, reasoning, and thinking rather than feeling, emotions, and going out on a limb by making ‘gut-feel’ decisions. The test results indicate that I have an executive personality, which reflects my love for leadership and delegation in order to successfully achieve desired outcomes.</p>
								<p>The results suggest that some of my weaknesses are that I may be inflexible, stubborn, uncomfortable with unconventional situations, judgemental and overly stressed. Knowing and understanding these as my weaknesses will heavily influence my way of thinking. For instance, I will strive to keep an open mind to new ideas rather than stick with what I am comfortable with, however, I would also use the results of this test in terms of my now known strengths such as being direct, dedicated, honest and reliable to ensure that I utilise my strengths to their fullest potential. If a leadership opportunity were to present itself, I would confidently volunteer due to the strengths identified in the test results.</p>
								<p>These results will influence how I form a team as I will be more mindful of selecting team-mates (where possible) that are potentially more creatively minded, as this is an area of potential weakness for me,  and the more diversity  covered in the team, the more perspectives we can consider, the more likely we are to succeed in what we set out to achieve.</p>
								<h3>LifeTrain Learning Styles Quiz</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/test2.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I believe that the test results suggest that I learn in a very structured and focussed way. I work well when I am given a list of things to do and respond well to the traditional classroom model. As I received the Theorist style, I believe that this means I am rational and apply structured logic to most situations.</p>
								<p>The test shows what style of learning works best for me, therefore in a team I will alter my behaviour to match the theorist style of learning. This may include asking team members to explain certain concepts through story telling for instance. I will also make use of clearly identifying and assigning/having tasks assigned in order to create structure. I will ensure that the project work is organised, and all team members have a consistent understanding on how we agree to approach the work.</p>
								<p>When forming a team, wherever possible I will search for people with a similar learning style to myself, as explanations and understanding concepts will be much easier if we all learn in a similar way with a unified approach.</p>
								<h3>Big Five Personality Test</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/test3.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I believe that the test results suggest that I am outgoing, social,  friendly, and careful at the same time. The three most notable factors for me correspond very accurately to my personality as my three biggest traits would be that I’m an extrovert, I’m extremely conscientious and my agreeable nature  is also a notable strength of mine.</p>
								<p>The test results reflect that I am traditional and conventional.  In a team setting, I believe I would therefore need to adapt my behaviour so that I am more open minded and be more willing to take on new and less traditional ideas.</p>
								<p>As my second lowest factor was imagination, I will ensure that I look for people that have a higher capacity in this area to increase team diversity and ensure that the team is not disadvantaged by having a very skewed and  way of executing and coming up with ideas.</p>
								<h3>Conclusion - My Main Attributes</h3>
								<p> <ul>
                  <li>Extraverted</li>
                  <li>Logical</li>
                  <li>Dedicated</li>
									<li>Rational</li>
									<li>Conscientious</li>
									<li>Friendly</li>

								<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cot.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Tea and Coffee is a project idea that will facilitate social meetups for RMIT students. Tea and Coffee will be a platform where students can host and attend social events that are presented through the app. Whether it be for tea, coffee, study, or even to watch some anime, users will be able to easily connect and attend get-togethers with peers with whom they share breaks and may not normally have interacted with. Through this app, users will be able to see what’s going on around them, during their breaks or free time, and if nothing is already on, can simply create an event such as, “Study group for first year programming or “Coffee and cake at Starbucks”. </p>
								<p>At RMIT, there were close to 97,193 student enrolments in 2019 <<a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/facts-figures">https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/facts-figures</a>>. That is nearly 100,000 students. As a first year undergraduate, a big difficulty for me has been meeting new people and filling in free time between classes. After speaking to some of my classmates, I  came to the realisation that this was an  extremely common issue. RMIT being in such a central location means that students are coming from all across Melbourne and even the world, with different timetables and levels of confidence in talking to people and  knowledge in travelling around the CBD. This is why I have conceptualised the Tea and Coffee application to address some of these issues. By having access to an app that works with your specific schedule, and in your general location, it becomes much easier to attend events and start meeting new people. </p>
								<p> Students will need to sign into the application using their RMIT credentials  which will ensure that they are students. They will then be asked for permissions to features such as location services, etc. Users will then be presented with a pre-filled profile including some details such as name, course, age, , and gender. This information is taken from the RMIT database and can be edited as well as removed if users want certain information to remain private. Students can also add things to their profile such as hobbies if they choose to. Users will then be presented with 5 tabs; Timetable, Explore, My Events, Messages and Profile. </p>
                <p> The ‘Timetable’ tab can be exported from allocate+ or manually entered, the user will be able to select which option they prefer. This tab is here so that users can quickly check when they have breaks throughout their days.</p>
                <p> The  ‘Explore’ tab  allows users to see which events are occurring near them (using location services) and when. By clicking on an event, users will be shown what the event is, the location and who is attending. From here, all that needs to be done is to select ‘Attending’ on the event and then the event will be added to the ‘My Events’ tab.  In the ‘Explore’ tab, there is also the option to add a new event. Here, users can click on the ‘+’ icon to create a new event. They will then need to specify what the event is (e.g. Studying, General Hangout, etc.), as well as the time/date and location.</p>
                <p> In the ‘My Events’ tab, users will see all of the events that they have marked as ‘Attending’. In this tab, users can also check the details of events they will be attending, comment on the event and have the ability to directly message the host of the event. Here, events that you are hosting are also shown and editable. Hosts also have the ability to clone past events that they have hosted, with a new date in the future.</p>
                <p> The ‘Messages’ tab ensures that attendees can communicate with the host of an event (and hosts can communicate with attendees). If for instance there is a study session in the library, you may not know where exactly the group is in the library. If you don’t want to make a public comment through the events tab, you can message and ask the host where exactly they are meeting. Likewise, if you’re a host, this is where you will be able to receive and respond to messages from members of the event. These messages will be stored in the messages tab and will be separate to the comments available for all attendees and the host of an event on the event itself. </p>
                <p> The last tab is the user’s ‘Profile’. This is where users can customise and edit their profile, which will be visible to other users. They can add pictures or select a generic  avatar and choose which details are shown on their profile. The options for updating their profile will apply to all fields;  picture/avatar, name (e.g. can be updated to a nickname), gender, course, age,  and an ‘About me’ section in which they can add whatever information they would like. Users can choose to view or edit their profile as often as they like.</p>
								<p>Although it may be simpler to use tools such as MIT App Inventor to create my app, I believe that the best way to go about this is to code the app myself using Java and other toolsets that I will learn throughout this degree. I think that  software such as android studio will also  assist me in creating my first app given that mobile devices will be my target platform. In terms of hardware, all that will be needed is a basic laptop that can run android studio 3.6+, such as my personal computer. It would also be ideal to have a stable and reliable internet connection, as research will need to be done to further develop and polish the app. Online code lab resources may also be useful in helping to learn build on my understanding of  the fundamentals of app creation. </p>
								<p>I have looked at a code lab, ‘Build Your First Android App in Java',<<a href="https://developer.android.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app#0">https://developer.android.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app#0</a>> which provides guidelines on to building your first app. In this resource, it is said that you should be an experienced programmer and adept at reading code. In terms of feasibility -  during my course I expect to become experienced with Java, and I believe that the skills that I will learn during my degree will be enough to code the basic framework this app. The software being used is easily accessible as is the hardware, as there isn’t anything that is out of the ordinary or difficult to find. </p>
								<p>If the coding is too difficult to successfully execute, or doesn’t work efficiently, we may need to use an app creator such as MIT. We also need to consider iOS apps which use the programming language of swift, which is something that needs to be considered.</p>
								<p>If the project is successful, walking around campus there should be a lot less students sitting by themselves during breaks, and we should see people in classrooms communicating more and socialising as well as working more cohesively as a team to complete their work. If students can meet even one new person through the app, then this will have been successful. The impact will be tremendous as having a supportive network of people around you can heavily alter your mood, drive, mental health, work ethic and overall, your wellbeing.  Its not always easy to walk up to people and talk to them, however with this app, users will be in a similar situation and hopefully this is a much easier way of meeting people.</p>
